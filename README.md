# JustStreamIt 

The project aim to create a user interface for a Web Application. The goal is to let users know top-rated movies from 
various categories(Based on IMDB score). The project is largely inspired by Netflix. To get movies data I worked with 
the following REST API:
https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR 

## 1. Getting data from API.

If you want to know how to install and get the data from the OCMovies-API,
please, read the following documentation:

## 2. About browsers.

Our website works on Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge. Unfortunately, we didn't 
have the possibility to check for Safari. But normally, everything should be ok.

## 3. About the W3C.

Some html tag get inner html dynamically with javascript. The src of movie images
of modals are dynamically added by javascript. Consequently, src is empty and the W3C show error message about that.
